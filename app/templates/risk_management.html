                        <p class="mb-4">Let us take an export operation by way of example. When an exporter and a bank arrange foreign exchange insurance, the latter fixes a currency rate against the euro at a specific date. So, if the spot price for the US dollar is quoted at 1.25 (€1 = $1.25), and the exporter takes out foreign exchange insurance for three months (the time it will take to collect payment in dollars), the bank will set the insurance at, for example, 1.247.</p>

                                <li>If the exchange rate for the US dollar falls he will not suffer losses</li>
                                <li>If the US dollar appreciates, he will miss out on earnings</li>
                                <li>Therefore the foreign exchange insurance covers the losses</li>

                            <li class="mb-2">It would borrow 100,000 US dollars at 90 days on the Interbank Market</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">For this loan it would pay the US dollar Libor rate: 2%.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">It would sell the US dollars on the spot market for euros.</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">It would place the euros on the interbank market for 90 days at 3% (Euribor).</li>
                            <li class="mb-2">Once the 90 days had elapsed the bank would redeem the loan in US dollars using the dollars paid to it by the customer using the proceeds of the export operation and in turn the bank would pass on to the exporting customer the euros it had placed on the Interbank Market.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4"><strong>Maintaining the same example, the mathematical calculation is as follows:</strong></p>
                        <p class="mb-4">It has cost the insuring bank 2% to borrow the US dollars. On the other hand, the same insuring bank has earned 3% (Euribor) by placing the euros on the Interbank Market. The upshot is that the bank has obtained a difference in interest of 1%, which it passes on to the exporter in the forward price.</p>

                                <p class="mb-2">Suppose for example that an exporter is going to receive 100,000 US dollars within three months. The spot price for the dollar is 1.250 and the rate quoted for foreign exchange insurance is 1.247. The exporter however wishes to exchange his dollars at 1.230. He will acquire an option to sell (put option) at 1.230. The selling bank charges him a premium, say $0.017 for every US dollar.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0">When the option settlement day comes round (three months later) the spot market offers a US dollar exchange rate of 1.260. Obviously the exporter will exercise his right to sell his US dollars to the bank at 1.230.</p>

                        </div>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">Strike price $1.230 + 0.017 premium = 1.247 US dollars for every euro. This result works out just the same as if he had taken out foreign exchange insurance at 1.247. It could have transpired that at the settlement date the US dollar was quoted at, for example, 1.200. In this eventuality the exporter would not exercise the option and would sell the dollars on the market at 1.200.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">There is also the American option, which can be exercised at any time during its term, in other words from the moment it is acquired to the time it expires.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="h5 text-secondary mb-3">Zero-Premium Options (Tunnel)</h4>
                        <p class="mb-4">This is based on a simultaneous option to buy and an option to sell for the same amount and the same expiry date, in such a way that the premiums cancel each other out. In this way a sort of price tunnel is created, ensuring the exchange rate for some fixed values of the strike prices, and restricting the possibilities for making both profits and losses.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">The two most fundamental components of a sales transaction, whether the transaction is domestic or international, are the delivery of the merchandise and collection of payment. The latter is undoubtedly crucial for an exporter. Obviously, any problem connected to the collection of payment for goods sold will be more difficult to resolve in foreign than in domestic trade operations. It is therefore in the interests of the exporter to build in as much security as possible when collecting the money owed from a sale.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">This greater degree of security in international trade payments may be obtained in a variety of ways; payments in advance, mechanisms involving documentary payments or bank guarantees, for example. Another way is "credit insurance" - in other words, the exporter obtains a guarantee, through an insurance company, that if the money from a sale is not collected, the insurance company will indemnify him for the loss incurred by non-payment. Credit insurance for domestic transactions works on a similar basis.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="h5 text-secondary mb-3">Concept</h4>
                        <p class="mb-4">An insurance contract that covers the exporter against the risk of non-payment, as well as other risks associated with selling abroad. In return for a premium, the insurance company agrees to indemnify the exporter against the loss incurred by the occurrence, as well as other risks connected to export operations.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="h5 text-secondary mb-3">Types of Risk</h4>
                        <p class="mb-4">The greatest risk normally covered by credit insurance is non-payment on the part of the buyer, which is specifically known as <strong>credit risk</strong>, in other words, the risk that exists from the moment the goods are sent until they are paid for.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">The other important risk that can be covered is the one where the manufacturer is given an order which is subsequently cancelled. This risk is particularly significant in the case of products that are made to order, as is the case with many capital goods and equipment (machinery, ships etc.). This contingency is known as the <strong>contract resolution risk</strong>, in other words, the risk that exists from the moment the contract is signed until the goods are despatched.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">Similarly, the <strong>non-collection of merchandise</strong> risk can be covered, in other words when the buyer, in breach of the sales contract, does not take possession of the merchandise at the time and place agreed, and it has to be recovered by the exporter.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">However, there is another important way in which risks may be classified, which overlies the one above, depending on the reason for the non-payment. The risks are:</p>
